# Art Board

This html file uses the free API from the New York Metropolitan Art Museum to show random art from one of thier collections.  The default file looks for any file with the work "Moon" in any description field and randomly shows the art pieces full screen.
Some of the listing do not have links to image files, if the item image URL is blank, the script will wait 5 seconds and then try another random object.  if the Url is valid the script displays the image for 10 minutes before it fetches another one.
Future upgrades will include adding a text overlay with the title and artist.

Enjoy!
